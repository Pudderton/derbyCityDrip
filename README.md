The following contents are part of the Derby City Drip prefab web project.
As a first time project, I am aware I could make a lot of changes to improve the performance of the site.
Some Examples of problems I had during my time with the project(I might have fixed them by the time of the due date, but if not it will be a good project to avoid skill atrophy):

1) I used "padding" in areas where "margin" would have been best.

2) Set specific CSS rules to individual list items rather than a whole div (such as font)


The features used are the following:

CSS) A hamburger menu is located in the nav bar on smaller screens, on larger screens it displays the menus normally.

CSS) On the Desktop view the menu moves from a single column list into two coloumns, with a single item centered at the bottom between the two

JS) Javascript was used to validate an email, in which it displays the input on screen or gives an error if it's rejected.
