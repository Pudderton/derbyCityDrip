The following contents are part of the Derby City Drip prefab web project.
As a first time project, I am aware I could make a lot of changes to improve the performance of the site.

I had a few problems when I first started, mainly resulting in messy code and just not really being sure what I was doing (lots of guessing and looking things up).
This became much less of a problem as I started getting familiar with the flow.

I believe most of these troubles were a result of the learning pattern. Specifically learning something early on and then applying it much later.
The Demos within Pluralsight helped reduce this problem, but skill atrophy is a very constant battle on my end.
Moving forward I will work around that and start working on a project as I go, so that I may apply the learned skills while they are still fresh in my mind.
It's probably best to maintain a constant flow of projects either way, so that I may grow my skillset.

The features used are the following:

CSS) A hamburger menu is located in the nav bar on smaller screens, on larger screens it displays the nav menu normally.

CSS) On the Desktop/Tablet view the Menu moves from a single column list into two coloumns, with a single item centered at the bottom between the two in the "Coffee" portion.

JS) Javascript was used to validate an email, in which it displays the input on screen or gives an error if it's rejected.
